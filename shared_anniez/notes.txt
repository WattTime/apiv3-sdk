Added a toy algorithm that
- inputs: 
    - mandatory: total carbon charge, expected carbon forecast 
    - optional: min/max/fixed charge per time period, covariance matrix of carbon forecast, additional cost for starting, maintaining and stopping charging
- outputs: optimal schedule, carbon cost, carbon "utility" (with uncertainty)
next steps: 
- impose constraints such as 
    - "must reach 90% of goal within first three hours" 
    - contiguity: currently achievable by imposing large "fake" cost for starting and stopping charge, but algorithm can be further optimized if we only want one period
- more flexibility in measuring carbon cost. add layer that includes carbon cost and startup/shutdown cost, but no uncertainty
- add framework for testing this on small data example
- under strong non diagonal covariance structures, optimality isn't guaranteed
