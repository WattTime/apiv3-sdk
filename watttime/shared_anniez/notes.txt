Added a toy algorithm that
- inputs: 
    - mandatory: total carbon charge, expected moer forecast 
    - optional: min/max/fixed charge per time period, full covariance matrix of moer forecast error, additional cost for starting, maintaining and stopping charging
- outputs: optimal schedule, carbon cost, carbon "utility" (with uncertainty)

Next steps: 
- impose contiguity constraints: currently achievable by imposing large "fake" cost for starting and stopping charge, but algorithm can be further optimized if we only want one period
- more flexibility in measuring carbon cost. add layer that includes carbon cost and startup/shutdown cost, but no uncertainty
- add framework for testing this on small data example
- need to implement algorithm for nondiagonal errors covariance 


- testing
